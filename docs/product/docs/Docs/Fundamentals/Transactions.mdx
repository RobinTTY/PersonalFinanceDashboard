A transaction is a monetary exchange between two parties. For instance you going to your favorite restaurant and paying for a meal.

A party in this sense can be a person, a company or some type of other entity. Sometimes you might even have instances where the two parties are kind of the same person. For instance if you withdraw cash from an ATM, the money doesn't change hands but the two parties involved are your bank account and your cash available to you in your wallet.
